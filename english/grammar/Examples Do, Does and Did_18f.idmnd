(Does, however, is substituted for third-person, singular subjects in the present tense. The past tense did works with all persons, singular and plural.)<br>I don't study at night.<br>She doesn't work here anymore.<br>Do you attend this school?<br>Does he work here?<br>These verbs also work as "short answers," with the main verb omitted.<br>Does she work here? No, she doesn't work here.<br>With "yes-no" questions, the form of do goes in front of the subject and the main verb comes after the subject:<br>Did your grandmother know Truman?<br>Do wildflowers grow in your back yard?<br>Forms of do are useful in expressing similarity and differences in conjunction with so and neither.<br>My wife hates spinach and so does my son.<br>My wife doesn't like spinach; neither do I.<br>Do is also helpful because it means you don't have to repeat the verb:<br>Larry excelled in language studies; so did his brother.<br>Raoul studies as hard as his sister does.<br>The so-called emphatic do has many uses in English.<br>To add emphasis to an entire sentence: "He does like spinach. He really does!"<br>To add emphasis to an imperative: "Do come in." (actually softens the command)<br>To add emphasis to a frequency adverb: "He never did understand his father." "She always does manage to hurt her mother's feelings."<br>To contradict a negative statement: "You didn't do your homework, did you?" "Oh, but I did finish it."<br>To ask a clarifying question about a previous negative statement: "Ridwell didn't take the tools." "Then who did take the tools?"<br>To indicate a strong concession: "Although the Clintons denied any wrong-doing, they did return some of the gifts."<br>In the absence of other modal auxiliaries, a form of do is used in question and negative constructions known as the get passive:<br>Did Rinaldo get selected by the committee?<br>The audience didn't get riled up by the politician.<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>When do I use DO/DOES/DID?<br>The structure of questions in English varies depending on the verb.  Verbs are divided into two categories: <br>1. to be <br>2. ALL other verbs (DO/DOES/DID)<br>If the verb is (to be), then the grammar will be different. If the verb is any other verb except (to be), then we use DO/DOES/DID as the helping or auxiliary verb.  We also use DO/DOES/DID for negative statements, but for this post, let's take a look at questions.  At the end of this post, you can find information about questions using the verb TO BE.<br>Questions: ALL Other Verbs (Using DO/DOES/DID)<br>To form questions in English using any other verb except (to be), we must use the helping or auxilary verbs: DO/DOES/DID.  Remember that DO/DOES we use in the present tense with the following subjects:<br>PRESENT TENSE (AUXILIARY VERB): DO/DOES<br>Do (I, you, we, they) understand English?<br>Does (he, she, it, your mother, the man) speak well?<br>PAST TENSE (AUXILIARY VERB): DID<br>And we use DID in the past tense with all subjects:<br>Did (I, you, he, she, it, we, they) pass the exam?<br>When forming questions with DO/DOES/DID, we use the following format:<br>Question Word + DO/DOES/DID + Subject + Verb<br>What                 + do                      +you        +like to do on the weekends?<br>We use DO/DOES/DID with the present and past simple tenses as seen below.<br>Examples:<br>He likes to play baseball.= Does he like to play baseball?<br>They went shopping yesterday.= Did they go shopping yesterday?<br>They do their homework after dinner.= Do they do their homework after dinner?<br>She travels to Asia every summer.= Where does she travel every summer?<br>We go jogging at 7:00 am every morning.= When do you go jogging?<br>I went to class four times per week.= How often did you go to class?<br>Questions: TO BE<br>To form questions using the verb to be, all we do is switch the position of the subject and verb.  Remember, we use the verb to be in the present, past, continuous, future (going to) and passive constructions, as seen below.<br>Examples:<br>He is Italian= Is he Italian? (present)<br>They are going to participate in the contest=  Are they going to participate in the contest? (future)<br>She is leaving soon!= Is she leaving soon? (continous/future)<br>The door is closed.= Is the door closed? (present passive)<br>The children were swimming all day long.= Were the children swimming all day long? (past continuous)<br>He is being interrogated by the FBI.= Is he being interrogated by the FBI? (present continuous)","md5i":"e0e49923bc7bc94cf18f0f4d462ffbd8"}
